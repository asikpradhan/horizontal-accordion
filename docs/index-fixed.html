            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p><strong>The underpinnings of how we conceptualize knowledge are a reflection of what and who we
                value. </strong></p>
            <p>In the United States, we value whiteness, patriarchy, simplicity, and capitalism. This translates into
                what we believe to be true, what we hold as valid, what we accept as evidence and what we perceive as
                truth. By not naming or interrogating what is implicit, we are generating knowledge and creating a
                historical record through our efforts that is full of half truths - and in some cases lies.</p>

        <section class="accordion-fixed-item--content">
            <h2>Validity</h2>
            <p>An expanded definition of validity allows for the complexity of considerations of the human experience
                (and in relation to context, culture and power) that enables us to better understand our efforts (let
                alone their effects), intended and unintended.</p>

        <section class="accordion-fixed-item--content">

            <h2>Rigor</h2>
            <p>This speaks to reliability (accuracy) and validity (soundness). It speaks to what and whom is valued and
                what is considered truth.</p>

        <section class="accordion-fixed-item--content">
            <h2>Bias</h2>
            <p>Humans have biases. Whatever we create reflects those biases. It is important to name the implicit and
                unstated biases in the approaches and methodologies we hold as core. By doing so, we can better decide
                what to use, why, and when, as well as consider what we should make explicit when sharing findings.</p>

            <h2>Objectivity</h2>
            <p>It is not possible that who we are and how the world experiences us, and how we experience the world,
                does not shape what we see, understand and believe.</p>

            <h2>Evidence</h2>
            <p>What we determine as facts and truth is limited. It tends to favor data that is quantitative, does not
                challenge the dominant frame (whiteness) and is simple as opposed to complex.</p>

            <h2>Equity</h2>
            <p>This term often speaks to either the how or to the what end, but not both. We believe that evaluative
                practice should reflect the principles of equity in how it is designed and implemented as well as what
                it supports.</p>
